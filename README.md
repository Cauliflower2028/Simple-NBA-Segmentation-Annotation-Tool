# NBA-Segmentation-Annotation-Tool

A minimal, user-friendly tool for segmenting basketball players in video clips and generating annotation masks, designed for research and annotation workflows.  
 **Supports GPU acceleration and is intended for use on OSC (Ohio Supercomputer Center) Linux clusters.**

 This project builds upon techniques described in Roboflowâ€™s guide:  
[Identify Basketball Players with AI](https://blog.roboflow.com/identify-basketball-players/)

## UNDER CONSTRUCTION LOOK AT THIS INSTEAD:  
RUN THE FOLLOWING COMMANDS:  

#### CREATE AND ACTIVATE VENV  
conda create -n venv python=3.10 -y  
conda activate venv  

#### UPGRADE PIP  
pip install --upgrade pip  

#### LOAD FFMPEG YOU HAVE TO DO THIS EVERY TIME YOU OPEN THE TERMINAL  
module load ffmpeg/6.1.1  

#### Set GCC as the compiler  
export CC=gcc  
export CXX=g++  

#### FOR INSTALLING DEPENDENCIES  
pip install torch torchvision torchaudio --index-url https://download.pytorch.org/whl/cu126  
pip install numpy wheel ninja  
pip install pycocotools  
pip install Pillow  

#### FOR INSTALLING SAM2 REAL-TIME - RUN THE FOLLOWING COMMANDS  
**IMPORTANT**: You must run this command every time you open a new terminal session:  
git clone https://github.com/Gy920/segment-anything-2-real-time.git  
cd ./segment-anything-2-real-time  
pip install -e .  
python setup.py build_ext --inplace  
(cd checkpoints && bash download_ckpts.sh)  
cd ..  

#### FOR INSTALLING DEPENDENCIES - RUN THE FOLLOWING COMMANDS  
pip install gdown  
pip install inference-gpu  
pip install git+https://github.com/roboflow/supervision.git  
pip install git+https://github.com/roboflow/sports.git@feat/basketball  
pip install transformers num2words  
pip install flash-attn --no-build-isolation  

#### SET ENVIRONMENT VARIABLE  
export ONNXRUNTIME_EXECUTION_PROVIDERS="[CUDAExecutionProvider]"  

#### SETTING UP API KEYS  
#### CREATE A FILE NAMED ".env" ".env" SHOULD HAVE THE FOLLWING CONTENTS:  
HF_TOKEN=your_huggingface_token_here  
ROBOFLOW_API_KEY=your_roboflow_key_here  

#### GET HF_TOKEN FROM https://huggingface.co/settings/profile  
#### GET ROBOFLOW_API_KEY FROM https://app.roboflow.com/settings/api  

## DONT LOOK
## Prerequisites 

### 1. Have the Ohio Supercomputer Virtual Machine set up before setup.

See this [documentation](https://docs.google.com/document/d/18efM3UhXIMKOZ-e1weG6fw2CS5-esf2s--cmgjhlOIs/edit?usp=sharing) for setup.

### 2. System Requirements

- Linux environment (OSC Ascend cluster)

- CUDA 12.6.2 support

- GPU access (required for SAM2 installation and runtime)

- Python 3.10

- Conda package manager


# Installation:

### 1. CREATE AND ACTIVATE VENV
```bash
conda create -n venv python=3.10 -y  
conda activate venv
```

### 2. UPGRADE PIP
```bash
pip install --upgrade pip
```

### 3. Load Required Modules
**IMPORTANT**: You must run this command every time you open a new terminal session:
```bash
module load ffmpeg/6.1.1
```  

### 4. Set GCC as the compiler
```bash
export CC=gcc  
export CXX=g++
```

### 5. Installing dependencies  
```bash
pip install torch torchvision torchaudio --index-url https://download.pytorch.org/whl/cu126  
```

### 7. FOR INSTALLING SAM2 REAL-TIME - RUN THE FOLLOWING COMMANDS  
**IMPORTANT**: MAKE SURE TO REQUEST GPU BEFORE INSTALLING OR IT WILL NOT WORK!
```bash
git clone https://github.com/Gy920/segment-anything-2-real-time.git    
cd ./segment-anything-2-real-time  
pip install -e .  
python setup.py build_ext --inplace  
(cd checkpoints && bash download_ckpts.sh)  
cd ..
```

### 8. Install Additional Dependencies
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
pip install git+https://github.com/roboflow/supervision.git  
pip install git+https://github.com/roboflow/sports.git@feat/basketball
```

### 9. Set Environment Variable
```bash
export ONNXRUNTIME_EXECUTION_PROVIDERS="[CUDAExecutionProvider]"
```  

### 10. Configure API Keys

Create a .env file in your project root directory:
```bash
touch .env
```
Add the following contents to the .env file:
```bash
HF_TOKEN=your_huggingface_token_here  
ROBOFLOW_API_KEY=your_roboflow_key_here
```

GET HF_TOKEN FROM https://huggingface.co/settings/profile  
GET ROBOFLOW_API_KEY FROM https://app.roboflow.com/settings/api

## Troubleshooting 
**The biggest problem is installing SAM2. Make sure to request a GPU before installing!!**

## Using the Segmentation Tool

See the [demo](https://osumlb.slack.com/files/U09DJRDN33R/F09KNUBP25D/segmentationtool.mp4) video for instructions on using the model
